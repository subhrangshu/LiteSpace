# LiteSpace
An open-source highly distributed lite weight and fast database storage solution built with Go Lang, Redis and SQLite which can quickly scale up to YottaBytes scale. (1 YB = 1e+15 GB)

Works for both horizontal integration and vertical integration.

Developed as an easy and lite weight alternative to RedHat Ceph (faces problem with deployment and have reports of unexplained dataloss) and RedHat GlusterFS (which fails to perform well for data smaller than a 100KB range).

This is built on top of Fiber REST Api based on GoLang, Redis in-memory NoSQL database and SQLite local database.
